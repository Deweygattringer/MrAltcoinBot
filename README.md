THE PROFIT BOT

## Description
This Binance trading bot analyses the changes in price for a given cryptoasset and trades it on every dip.
it will then continue to hold it as long as the price is rising. also, it wil hold in the event the price drops further. it will not sell unless you are in profit, at least a little bit (at least thats how it should work).



The bot will listen to changes in price for a specific asset on Binance. By default, we're only picking USDT pairs. We're excluding Margin (like BTCDOWNUSDT) and Fiat pairs.

> Information below is an example and is all configurable
- The bot checks the price every minute. if the price reaches a new higher price it will save this new high.
- The bot checks if the coin has gone down by more than x% from the previous high (ie when the price dips)
- The bot will buy with x% of your free USDT volume in this coin.
- The bot will sell only when at profit. in a bearish scenario, this means that it might take a very long time for the bot to sell.
